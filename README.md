## Digit Recognition
Overview:
The Digit Recognition project involves training a deep learning model to accurately identify handwritten digits. Recognizing digits from images is a fundamental task in computer vision and serves as a foundation for various applications, including optical character recognition (OCR) systems. This project employs convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to achieve high accuracy in classifying digits ranging from 0 to 9.

Objectives:
Data Collection:

Utilize well-known datasets like MNIST, which consists of labeled handwritten digits.
Explore the dataset to understand its structure and characteristics.
Data Preprocessing:

Normalize pixel values to the range [0, 1] to enhance model training.
Visualize sample images to gain insights into the dataset.
Model Architecture:

Design a CNN architecture suitable for digit recognition.
Experiment with convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers.
Choose an appropriate activation function and optimizer.
Model Training:

Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
Train the model using the training set and validate it on the testing set.
Implement techniques like dropout to prevent overfitting.
Evaluation:

Assess the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, confusion matrix, and precision-recall curves.
Visualize the learned filters and feature maps to interpret the model's behavior.
Deployment:

Save the trained model for future use in digit recognition applications.
Explore deployment options, such as integrating the model into a web or mobile application.
Dependencies:
